In this project we are trying to classify Iris Flowers using their specific features like Petal Length, Petal Width, Sepal Length and Sepal Width. The different classes of  Iris Flowers we 
will use for this project are Iris Setosa, Iris versicolor and Iris Virginica, the image above displays the three classes.

The project is built using python.

The machine learning used are:
     1. KNearest Neighbour(KNN).
     2. Support Vector Machine(SVM).
   >>Turned out they both had the same accuraccy score of 93.33
