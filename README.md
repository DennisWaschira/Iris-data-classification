This project aims to classify Iris Flowers based on their specific features, including Petal Length, Petal Width, Sepal Length, and Sepal Width. The identified classes of Iris Flowers in this project are Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolor, and Iris Virginica, as illustrated in the image above.

## Project Overview

The implementation is done in Python, utilizing machine learning techniques for classification. The following machine learning algorithms have been employed:

1. K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN).
2. Support Vector Machine (SVM).

Surprisingly, both KNN and SVM demonstrated identical accuracy scores of 93.33%.
